# Contributing to Podroid

Thanks for considering a contribution. Bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests are all welcome.

Before you start, please skim [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md). It documents the VM-engine abstraction and both backends, the boot pipeline, every native binary, and the design quirks you need to know to make changes that don't regress.

## Getting started

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ExTV/Podroid.git
cd Podroid
```

You will need:

- **Docker 20.10+** for the kernel, initramfs, rootfs, and QEMU build pipelines
- **JDK 17 or newer** to run Gradle (`sourceCompatibility`/`targetCompatibility` in `app/build.gradle.kts` are `VERSION_17`)
- **Android NDK r27c** for the bridge and Termux native libraries
- **Android SDK** with platform 36 + build-tools
- An **arm64 Android device** running **Android 8.0+ (API 26)** for testing

## Build pipeline

`build-all.sh` orchestrates every component, in the order a from-scratch build needs them:

```sh
./build-all.sh kernel       # custom Linux kernel (~5-10 min, Docker-cached)
./build-all.sh initramfs    # kernel + minimal initramfs
./build-all.sh rootfs       # Alpine squashfs (~30 s, Docker-cached)
./build-all.sh qemu         # QEMU + podroid-bridge (~30 min first run)
./build-all.sh apk          # Android APK via Gradle
./build-all.sh all          # everything, in the order above
./build-all.sh deploy       # APK + install in place (adb install -r)
./build-all.sh test         # deploys APK, polls console.log for "Ready!"
```

`kernel` and `initramfs` both produce the same kernel image, so you only need one of them if you are not also touching the initramfs; `apk` needs whatever `rootfs`/`qemu`/`initramfs` last produced to already be on disk, since it just runs Gradle.

| Step | Produces | Lands in |
|---|---|---|
| `kernel` | `vmlinuz-virt` | `app/src/main/assets/vmlinuz-virt` |
| `initramfs` | `vmlinuz-virt` + `initrd.img` | `app/src/main/assets/` |
| `rootfs` | `alpine-rootfs.squashfs` | `app/src/main/assets/alpine-rootfs.squashfs` |
| `qemu` | `libqemu-system-aarch64.so`, `libslirp.so`, `libpodroid-bridge.so`, `libpodroid-launcher.so` | `app/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a/` |
| `qemu` | `efi-virtio.rom`, keymaps | `app/src/main/assets/qemu/` |
| `apk` | `app-debug.apk` | `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/` |

Component versions are pinned in one place each, so read the pin rather than trusting a number written in prose:

| Component | Pinned in |
|---|---|
| Linux kernel | `podroidKernelVersion` in `gradle.properties` |
| QEMU | `podroidQemuVersion` in `gradle.properties` |
| Alpine | `ARG ALPINE_RELEASE` in `build-rootfs/Dockerfile.rootfs` |

**`kernel` and `initramfs` pass `docker build --network=host`; `qemu` and `rootfs` do not.** Both of those stages `apt-get`/`apk`/`curl` packages from inside the container, and on some hosts the default bridge network's DNS does not resolve there, which shows up as `apt-get`/`apk` saying a package "has no installation candidate", or a `curl`/`wget` step failing outright. If that happens, rerun the failing stage's `docker build` by hand with `--network=host` added (see `build_qemu`/`build_rootfs` in `build-all.sh` for the exact command to replicate) rather than assuming the package is gone upstream.

Or, for the common case where you only changed Kotlin / UI code:

```sh
./gradlew installDebug
```

## Customising the guest

- **Add a package to the base image:** add it to the `apk add` list in `build-rootfs/build-rootfs.sh` (e.g. `mc`), then `./build-all.sh rootfs`. New packages land on the next VM boot with no reset, since the squashfs is a plain-overlay lower (see `CLAUDE.md`'s "VM migration / upgrades").
- **OpenRC services:** live under `build-rootfs/files/etc/init.d/`, wired into the `default`/`boot` runlevels by direct symlinks at the end of `build-rootfs.sh` (the build host is x86_64 and can't `chroot` into the aarch64 rootfs to run `rc-update`).
- **Swapping Alpine for another distro is not supported.** `init-podroid` (overlay + `switch_root`), the OpenRC runlevel wiring, and the musl-static cross-compiled helpers (`podroid-hostd`, `podroid-vsock-agent`, `podroid-overlay-normalize`) all assume an Alpine root. Moving to another distro would mean replacing the init system integration, the `apk`-based package step in `build-rootfs.sh`, and rebuilding those helpers against that distro's libc.

## Reporting bugs

Please open an issue using the **Bug Report** template. The most useful single thing you can attach is the diagnostic log:

`Settings → Diagnostics → Export Log`

It bundles app version, device model + Android version, settings, and full logcat in one file. If the bug is VM-side, also include the VM console:

```sh
adb shell run-as com.excp.podroid.debug cat files/console.log
```

Note that `run-as` works on debug builds only. Release builds are not `run-as`-able, so use the in-app export there.

## Submitting changes

1. Fork the repository and create a topic branch (`fix/issue-42`, `feature/whatever`).
2. Keep pull requests focused: one fix or one feature per PR.
3. Work through the checklist below before opening the PR.
4. Match the existing code style of the file you are editing.

### Before you open a PR

**Run the unit tests.** Use the `:app:` form; the bare task name does not behave the same way.

```sh
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest
```

**Test on a real arm64 device.** Emulators do not exercise the QEMU and native-binary path the way real hardware does. Unit tests cover pure logic only, so anything touching VM behaviour, the engine boundary, or a user-visible flow is unproven until it runs on hardware.

If your change touches the engine boundary or AVF, note that the two backends need two different devices: only a device reporting `android.software.virtualization_framework` can exercise AVF at all.

```sh
adb shell pm list features | grep virtualization
```

See [Proving a change on a device](CLAUDE.md#proving-a-change-on-a-device) for the grant sequence and which backend needs which device. **Say in the PR which backends you actually tested on.** Backend asymmetry is the most common source of bugs here, so a QEMU-only test is the easiest way to ship a regression.

**Add both translations for any user-facing string.** Every string needs an entry in `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` and `app/src/main/res/values-zh/strings.xml`, and must be referenced with `stringResource`. Do not hardcode user-facing text.

**Never rename a DataStore key without a migration.** Saved user state has to survive every release, since updates install in place. The Kotlin identifier is free to change, but the string literal is an on-disk contract: renaming it orphans the stored value and the setting silently reverts to its default on the user's next launch. `DataStoreKeyContractTest` will fail if you change one. If the rename is deliberate, ship a migration that reads the old key and writes the new one, and update the expectation in the same commit.

**Update the docs your change affects.** If it is user-facing, update [`README.md`](README.md). If it changes the architecture, boot pipeline, terminal layer, or kernel options, update [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) too.

### Commit messages

This repository uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `type(scope): summary`, all lowercase.

```
fix(avf): distinguish an absent GPU API from a failed declaration
docs(site): explain how to reach the desktop from another computer
test(data): pin the persisted DataStore key literals
```

The body should explain **why** the change is needed, not restate what the diff does. A reader six months from now needs the reasoning, not a summary they could get from `git show`.

Avoid `fixes #N` or `closes #N` unless you intend the issue to close when the commit lands, since those keywords close issues automatically. Use `for #N` or `addresses #N` to reference without closing.

## Code style

- Kotlin: follow the [official conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html).
- Keep it simple. No premature abstractions.
- Match the surrounding file's style. Consistency beats personal preference.
- Comments explain *why*, not *what*. Self-documenting names go further than prose.
- No emoji, and no em dashes, in code, comments, commit messages, or documentation. Use hyphens, commas, colons, or restructure the sentence.
